# SC2-Python-Bot
## Preface
Team project to implement a full AI for Starcraft II, utilizing reinforcement learning through the use of the Q-Learning Algorithm and a great deal of abstraction. This is accomplished by utilizing DeepMind’s pysc2, the Python component of the StarCraft II Learning Environment, which provides an interface for RL agents to interact with StarCraft II.<br />
